# Plum
As a member from the FT-Web12 was almost on the verge of completion of the second unit and it was during the final week which is depicted as the construct week in their coding Bootcamp where the students as a group of 4 build the clone of any major website and the one allotted for my team was “Plum.com”.
The Second Unit had the following topics in its curriculum:
Advanced Javascript datatypes
Working of web browsers
constructors
Callback, apply function
JSON fundamentals
Local storage, session storage and cookies functionalities
Asynchronous programming in Js
Promises and their uses
Pagination
We implemented problem solving using basic data structures and we conducted regular contests to enhance the problem solving ability of the candidate
Soft skills training for enhancing candidate’s communication skills, writing skills and to stay motivated and consistent throughout the well defined strict curriculum.
Training and Support team
Swanand Kadam (Technical training)
Yogesh Bhat (Soft skills training)
Vishal Kumar (Instructional Associate)
We accomplished this project because of the immense support and commitment from the above faculty and my teammates.
Project description, the team and the work spilt up :
Plum is a website that is beauty product website.
As a team of 4, we rendered the major parts of the website where I was allocated 2 pages.
Making deeper insights into my work
I built this page using basic HTML; the styling was done with plain CSS and most of the HTML elements were rendered from the Js code using the method of DOM manipulation. In this, I created and use JS to look similar to the page. I use advance HTML and CSS too to improve the website more look like the original. In overall words, I learn a lot from this project. I learn deep things when I was doing this project. I know to apply each and everything in a channelized way. During week 1 when HTML and CSS had started, I was thinking about how will I do it. Same with JavaScript, but right now I know many things to make a website. How the website works how things are using in the backend.
In this CW week, I learn a lot and apply all the past 4weeks of things in the 5th week.
Thank You!.
